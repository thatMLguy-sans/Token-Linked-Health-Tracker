# Token-Linked Health Tracker

## Description

The Token-Linked Health Tracker is a revolutionary blockchain-based smart contract built on the Aptos network that incentivizes healthy lifestyle habits through cryptocurrency rewards. This innovative health tracking system allows users to earn tokens by logging their daily physical activities, specifically step count, creating a direct financial motivation for maintaining an active lifestyle.

The smart contract features a simple yet effective reward mechanism where users earn 1 token for every 1000 steps they log. Users can create their personal health profiles on the blockchain, track their cumulative fitness progress, and receive immediate token rewards for their physical activities. This gamification of health and fitness through blockchain technology creates a sustainable ecosystem where healthy habits are directly rewarded with digital assets.
